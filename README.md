# Image-Generation-Using-Stable-Diffusion-and-Comfy-UI
This project demonstrates the use of Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI for generating images from text prompts. ComfyUI's node-based interface provides a flexible and powerful way to design and execute complex image generation workflows, making Stable Diffusion more accessible and controllable.

## 🎨 AI Image Generation with Stable Diffusion & ComfyUI

### 🚀 Overview
This project explores AI-powered image generation using Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI. By leveraging latent diffusion models (LDMs), we can generate high-quality images from text prompts with fine-grained control over details.

🔹 **Why Stable Diffusion?**
✅ Open-source & powerful 💡  
✅ Generates high-resolution images 📸  
✅ Customizable with LoRA, ControlNet, & IP-Adapters 🎛️  
✅ Works on consumer GPUs ⚡  

🔹 **Why ComfyUI?**
✅ Node-based workflow for better control 🛠️  
✅ Supports multi-stage processing 📊  
✅ Visual, flexible, and modular 🚀  
✅ Enhances image refinement & customization 🎨  

### 📌 Features
✔️ Generate images from text prompts 📝 → 🎨  
✔️ Modify & refine images using ControlNet & LoRA  
✔️ Node-based workflow for intuitive editing 🔄  
✔️ Batch processing & automation 🔥  
✔️ Custom fine-tuning for unique styles 🎭  

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Stable Diffusion** – AI-based image generation model
- **ComfyUI** – Node-based graphical workflow editor
- **Hugging Face Diffusers / Stable Diffusion WebUI** (optional)


### 📌 Usage
1. Launch the ComfyUI interface.
2. Select or create a new workflow.
3. Input text prompts and adjust parameters.
4. Generate and refine images.
5. Save or modify results as needed.

### 🛠️ Future Enhancements
